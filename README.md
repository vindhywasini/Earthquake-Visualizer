# Earthquake Visualizer (React + React-Leaflet)

## What this is
A complete React (Vite) project that visualizes recent earthquakes from the USGS "all_day" GeoJSON feed using React-Leaflet. This version does NOT use Tailwind — it uses plain CSS.

## How to run (on your machine)
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. In the extracted folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

> Note: I cannot run the app on your machine for you. The ZIP contains all source files — running requires Node.js and npm installed locally.

## Files included
- `src/` with React app
- `index.html`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`

## API used
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson
